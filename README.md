This type of chart is suitable for visualizing results from ablation studies or comparative experiments, especially in the following scenarios:

- **Model Component Impact Analysis**: To show how different components contribute to the overall model performance, such as changes in accuracy, F1 score, etc., after removing a specific module.  
- **Strategy Comparison Experiments**: To clearly illustrate performance differences under various settings, such as different algorithm designs, training strategies, or loss functions.  
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: To demonstrate the impact of removing certain features on model performance during feature engineering.  
- **Module Effectiveness Validation**: When introducing new modules or structures, this chart helps validate their effectiveness by gradually removing them and observing performance changes.
